                    A project for Centre Ceramique (soon Museum Maastricht), a museum in Maastricht. 
                    They have a beautiful collection of both pre-historic as well as bronze-age relics. 
                    There's many stories to be told, but no one there to experience them. In a team of 4 we 
                    set out to develop a user experience to make ancient history more engaging.

                An important guideline was the 5E model. Utilising this we crafted the experience all the way from the
                initial Excitement to the Extension, a reason to visit again.</p>

                            We wanted to do something with a pot since the ceramic's look, technique and quality changed a lot for various reasons. It was also a lot more accessible 
                            which is really important because you want to reach as many people as possible.

                            We developed both a physical and virtual prototype. Both of them representing this cave chamber 
                            where the user could spin a clay pot in the middle that would then change the scenery around them in the cave.
                            This way, by turning the pot they would gradually learn about the importance of ceramics in the neolithic era.</p>
