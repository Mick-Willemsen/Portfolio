                <p>
                    Codeventure was a project done in a team of 4 to provide a programming workshop for elementary schools.
                    We had to find a way to make programming fun and engaging for kids of that age to try and raise more 
                    awareness for their future in this digital age.

P5JS was an obvious choice. for kids it's important to see the effects of their actions, so having a play button that runs their code immediately was really useful. </p>

                        <h2>Ideation</h2>
                        <p>We wanted our project to be about discovery and creativity. So we came up with the Workshop "Coders of the Galaxy" 
                            Something that sounded recogniseable but with a twist. In this workshop the kids would use P5JS and learn how to make basic shapes and colors.
                            After following along they could try and come up with their own alien or fantasy landscapes.

We named our team CodeVenture and developed it to be able to provide workshops for various ages and levels of
education. Integrating that theme into the design it ended up being something playful but not too playful. With an accent color that could designate
the different levels of education. Along with the website we made a workbook for the kids to work in, cheat sheet included.</p>
